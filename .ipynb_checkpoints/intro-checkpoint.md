# Predicting Shopper Intentions

![logo](images/logo.jpg)

In this short Jupyter Book, we will try to predict Online Shoppers Intentions from data. The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset) is taken from the [uci webpage](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).


## Inspiration
This work is a required essay for the Mathematics in Machine Learning course by prof. Gasparini & Vaccarino @ PoliTO, a nice gym to exercise my machine learning & python skills, and an excuse to try out jupyter book. I hope this will be a useful platfrom for anybody to hopefully learn something new.

## Structure
The book is divided in 4 chapters:
1. [Data Exploration](chapters:data_exploration): here we go through some preliminary analysis of our data, plot it, and figure out what issues we will have to tackle further on in the analysis
2. [Pipelines](chapters:pipelines): in this section we merge the data preparation part of the analysis with the *sklearn*'s pipelines, to show how easy is to build modular code, where we can plug in and out different modules without almost any overhead.
3. [Model Exploration](chapters:model_exploration): The name Exploration is purposefully used to show that our aim is not to find the best model for our problem, because our aim is not to achieve a competitive score. Our goal, instead, is to show how to deal with this kind of problem, and to take a deeper approach to our models with respect to the typical machine learning tutorial.
4. [Appendix](chapters:appendix): here we will put all the extra information about the topics that we will go through. We also find a learning theory section, used to give a background to some of the claims we will make in our analysis.
